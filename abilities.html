        <h1 style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px; font-weight: bold;">Sel's power</h1>
        Sel has the ability to summon entirely random items with entirely random abilities and uses.
        This usually leads to objects that don't really want to follow the natural rules of physics, making this power an even bigger threat to herself than to others.
        A power like this alone would generally be useless, but luckily for her, she can control some of this chaos.
        <br><br>
        If she happens to summon an actually physics-obeying item, she can choose to "save" it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Think about it like this:
        <br>
        Everytime she summons a new item, she essentially rolls a HUGE die with many googols of sides.
        What number she rolls will be used as an index to "call" a certain item from, basically a very long list. A very long list with many googols of content.
        Since most of the items in that list are not compatible with her universes laws, they are useless, if not dangerous.
        <br>
        <br>
        What happens when she saves an item, is she actually saves the index of it, so she can call specifically that item again.
        However, it is really exhausting for her to work with these massive numbers, so she set herself a limit to be safe.
        <br>
        <br>
        She can only summon from saved indexes a maximum of 5 times per day. This also comes with the need for a full 8 hour sleep every night.
        <br>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">She can push this limit, but only in situations where there is no other choice.</span>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 35px; margin: 5px; font-weight: bold;">Highlights</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 26px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Now that we (hopefully) understand Sel's ability, let's take a look at the most interesting items she has saved:</p>
        <div class="list-group bg-dark" data-bs-theme="dark">
          <a href="" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Signal Dice - <span style="font-size: 25px;">A pack of 6 dice. Roll one of them and it will teleport to one of the dice with the rolled side up.</span></a>
          <a href="" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Dupe Marble - <span style="font-size: 25px;">A glass marble that can be cloned infinitely. (clones can be cloned too)</span></a>
          <a href="" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Phase Paint - <span style="font-size: 25px;">A bucket of really black paint that slowly phases through any surface it's applied to.</span></a>
          <a href="" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Weed - <span style="font-size: 25px;">Why do you think she is so chill all the time?</span></a>
          <a href="" class="list-group-item list-group-item-action">Ring of Invisibility - <span style="font-size: 25px;">When worn, the ring turns invisible. They won't expect that invisible knuckle sandwich!</span></a>
